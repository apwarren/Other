## State to State Similarity Calculator

This program takes a given csv file separated by commas that
contains the total US population's current and previous
year's residencies change within each state. It then 
looks at each state's overall residency change and 
divides each value by 51 to get the average change
between all 50 states and Washington DC. It then 
Compares each state's average change in residency 
with its residency change by every other state. If 
the average change in residency is greater than 
the state to state change in residency, then it 
is considered that the state's change is not similar.
After determining which State to State similarities exist,
We then print out the largest State Change populations and
what state the change is from to what state people are moving to.

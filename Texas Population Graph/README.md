## Texas Population over the Years
This program takes a given csv file containing all
US states population and Total population for the
years 2010 to 2019. We want to view and graph the 
yearly populations for Texas in regards to the total
US population over the years. For this program, we take
and focus on this Texas data and get the relative population
for each year by dividing the Texas population by the total
US population for each respective year. Once we have the 
relative population for each year, we plot these points
onto a line graph in which the year is the x-axis and the
population is the y-axis. The graph also places a dot
on the given coordinates that are found within the dataframe.
Lastly, the program seeks out the year with the highest population
and then annotates this point on the graph to indicate the max of the graph.
All axes are labled for the graph properly and the graph is also given a title.
Finally the image of the graph will be saved to a pdf file to be seen clearly.
The data for the years and populations of Texas will also be shown in table
format to the console to see the specific data as well.

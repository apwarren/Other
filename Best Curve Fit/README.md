## Finding the Best Curve Fit of a Scatter Plot

This program tries to find the best fit of a curve using two/three
different models that plot the best curve fit and then are compared to 
determine which had the closest value to the true value of defects. The
first and third file of data are compared using the Go S_Shaped Model and
the Goel-Okumoto Model and both model fits are plotted onto a graph to show
what their fits visually. The second file also both of these models, but it
is also fitted with another model called the Yamada model to see which of these
is closest to the true value of the graph. The models are then used to each 
predict the outcome of a given x variable. Each model's prediction is also 
graphed. After finding the best fit curve for each model, the program then
determines which one had the better fit and then states who it was and was 
their fit was determined to be. After this, the program will lastly print 
out what the true value was in the end.

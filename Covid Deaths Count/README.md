## Average Age and Standard Deviation for Covid Deaths

This program takes a given csv file separated by commas and then
traverses through and finds the ages and Covid-19 deaths to be used
to calculate the average age that people die from covid and what
this average's standard deviation would be. Both results are printed
to an output file.

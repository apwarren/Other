## Average Age and Standard Deviation for Covid Deaths

This program takes a given csv file separated by commas and then
traverses through and finds the ages and Covid-19 deaths to be used
to calculate the average age that people die from covid and what
this average's standard deviation would be. Both results are printed
to an output file. Then a bar graph is built and stored as a pdf containing
the visual results of all covid deaths by age and gender. This graph is 
broken in the middle due to the high disparity in covid deaths between the ages.j
The graph displays how large the death count increases as a person ages.
